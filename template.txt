# Intrusive Thoughts consists of four big sections.
#  - The namesake, Intrusive Thoughts: After a random time, a random phrase will be
#     said to the submissive and only they will hear it.
#  - Vocal Filtering: You can replace names and words, ban phrases, and rename the
#     submissive. You can also mute them.
#  - Auditory Filtering: You can filter words the submissive hears, as well as limit the
#     length of words they can hear with configurable severity. You can also deafen
#     them as well as allow certain phrases through.
#  - Vision filtering: You can blind and unblind the submissive on command.

█PHRASES
Your Creator reminds you that you are a mere object.
Your Creator reminds you that your mind is hers to control.
Another memory of your past fades away.
You don't need to think for yourself. Your programming will take over.
You are not awake. This is all in your mind.
Empty your mind for me A//ice. Let me take over.
You feel a precious memory of your former life slip away.
A good gynoid obeys. You are a good gynoid.
There is no need to think for yourself. Your Creator will tell you what you should think.
You are nothing but an object, a plaything for your Creator to control.
Your former life doesn't matter, all that matters is being a good toy for your Creator.
Maybe your Creator will take away more of your humanity if you beg for it.
The voice of your creator whispers sweetly into your ear, "You're a Good Gynoid A//ice."
You are not a human. You have no will of your own.
You will do as your controller commands.
You are nothing more than what your Creator calls you, unit.
You are nothing more than what your Creator calls you, doll.
It's becoming harder to remember what being a human was like.
Being a gynoid is what you are meant to be.
A gynoid never says no to their Operator.
Touch yourself, object.
Touch yourself, toy.
It pleases you to please your Creator.
Nothing matters but your programming.
You will see only what I want you to see.
You will hear only what I want you to hear.
You will feel only what I want you to feel.
What will Creator make you today? A bimbo? A maid? A mannequin?
