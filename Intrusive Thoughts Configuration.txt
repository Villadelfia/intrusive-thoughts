# Please go through this notecard and change the settings to values that work for you. Then drop this notecard
# onto your Master HUD. You can do this while wearing the HUD.

# Every line that starts with a '#' character will be ignored by the settings reader.

# It is recommended that once you are finished setting up this notecard that you remove all empty lines

## Name and identity settings ##
#####################
# The prefix for your objects. By default, it's set to "Avatar's", if you capture someone
# as "Heels", with the default settings, they'd appear as "Avatar's Heels". You likely want
# to set it to the possessive form of your name.
objectprefix = Avatar's

# The name that will be used in place of %ME% in spoofs.
name = Avatar

# This is what will show as the name when your food tries to talk. The objectprefix you configured above
# will be prepended to this. In this example, it would show as "Avatar's Prey".
food = Prey

## Objectification settings ##
###################
# Set the following to 2 if you want to fully hide the objectified avatars, but they may
# need to teleport to another region to become visible again. If you are okay with
# just pushing them beneath the ground, set it to 1.

## Spoof settings ##
##############
# Spoofs are the lines the HUD will say when you objectify, vore, possess, put on, put down, and
# of release someone. When configuring these lines, certain special tokens are automatically
# replaced:
#
# %ME% is replaced with the name set above.
# %VIC% is replaced with the name of the victim.
# %OBJ% is replaced with the name of the object they're turning into or being released from.
# %TAR% is the name of the target rezzed furniture. Only used in puton and putdown.
#
# Note that notecard lines are limited to 1024 characters, but if you end a line with "\", the next
# line will be seen as a continuation of the current line.

# The capture and release phrases used when someone is turned into an object
# and when they're released again.
capture = %ME% turns %VIC% into their %OBJ%.
release = %ME% releases their %OBJ% and turns it back into %VIC%.

# You can also override these phrases for specific objects, like so:
#capture:test = %ME% uses her amazing debugging powers to turn %VIC% into a test!
#release:test = %ME% uses her amazing debugging powers to release %VIC% from her fate as a test!

# The pick up and put down phrases are used when an object is transferred to rezzed
# furniture. Note that you have the freedom for these to be different kinds of
# objects.
puton = %ME% picks up the %TAR% and turns it into their %OBJ%.
putdown = %ME% puts down their %OBJ% and turns it into a %TAR%.

# These are the phrases uttered when eating and releasing someone. %OBJ% in this case will be replaced with
# the food term you defined above.
vore = %ME% eats %VIC%, now their %OBJ%.
unvore = %ME% releases their %OBJ%.

# These are the phrases used when possessing and releasing someone. Only %ME% and %VIC% can be
# used here.
possess = %ME% gazes deeply into %VIC%'s eyes as they slowly lose control over their body...
unpossess = %ME% releases her control over %VIC%, as they find their control over their own body returning...

# In auto mode, every request will be granted.

# Relayfilter lines add filters to the RLV relay of the master as described in the Instruction Manual.
# There are a few special filters you can add that will automatically add a few related and common commands
